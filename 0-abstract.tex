\begin{abstract}

An abstract is a short description (10-20 lines) of your thesis. Because on-line
search databases typically contain only abstracts, it is vital to write a
complete but concise description of your work to entice potential readers into
obtaining a copy of the full paper.

Although an abstract is brief, it should do almost as much work as the multi-page 
paper that follows it. Each chapter or section is typically a single sentence, 
but there is always room for creativity. In particular, parts may be merged or 
spread among a set of sentences.

\begin{abstract}[Sammanfattning]
If you write in English you don't have to write an abstract in Swedish but if
you write in Swedish you also must write an extended abstract in English. If you
write a second abstract, in a language different from the report itself, you
should also give the title in the second language.
