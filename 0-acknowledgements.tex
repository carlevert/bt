\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

It is common to thank the supervisors and others who have contributed.
The acknowledgent is usualy put first, or last, but can also be
written as a section in the intruction. However, if it is put first
or last as an own section, you propably don't want it to have an own
chapter number. For this you can use the \verb+\chapter*+ command, i.e.,
\begin{verbatim}
  \chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\end{verbatim}
This will now not be included in the table of cotents. If you
like to include it in the table of contents, you need to do this
manualy as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  \cleardoublepage   (or \clearpage)
  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}
  \chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\end{verbatim}

\cleardoublepage
