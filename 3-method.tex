\chapter{Method}

Can ranking be acomplished cheaper by using an online algorithm like q-digest
rather than Bucket with Global Query.

\section{Problem description revisited}

\begin{shaded}

Current implementation

Motivation for selecting q-digest

\end{shaded}

\section{Data}

Use synthetic data. Need to prove or at least argue that the synthetic data is valid for the experiment.

\begin{shaded}

  Distribution of highscores?

  Distribution over time?
 
\end{shaded}

\section{What and how to measure}

Get technical

Total execution time (update score + ranking)

Number of datastore accesses

Assume number of requests and data are equal

\section{Limitations}

The data set grows over time. Will be ignored, only focus on case when the set of highscores are reasonably large.
